<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Mechanical Engineer, though I have spent most of my professional career delivering Civil Infrastructure projects</p>

<p>My strengths are project management, problem solving and team work. I work well in fast paced environments and pride my self in my ability to create and maintain relationships with stakeholders and coworkers</p>

<p>I came to a realisation early this year that I do not want to stay in this field for the rest of my career and need to start looking into a career change. It is clear to me that software is the future and there will be an ever increasing demand for software developers. I find the advancement in AI and similar technologies facinating and would like to understand all I can.</p>
